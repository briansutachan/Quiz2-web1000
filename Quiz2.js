/* 9. ay you have a program which handles the login queue to a game server. The game server is able to log in one person every one second. Assume that one second must elapse after a person logs in with an empty queue before they are removed from the queue.

a- At 12:00:00 Hades logs in
b- At 12:00:00 Ares logs in
c- At 12:00:00 Zeus logs in
d- At 12:00:00 Buzz Light Year logs in
e- At 12:00:02 Kanye West logs in
f- At 12:00:03 Taylor Swift logs in
g- At 12:00:03 Darkwing Duck logs in
h- At 12:00:04 Evil Mickey logs in. */
